Welcome to the mock_streams documentation!
======================================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

mock_streams is a yt based code that creates a "mock" of a simulation according to some parameters. The idea is that this simulates a three-phase CGM, consisting of hot, outflowing bulk material, cool, inflowing streams, and an interface layer between the two. It does *not* simulate a galaxy in the middle! You can run analysis scripts on it like it were a cosmological simulation to see if its behavior seems realistic using yt, trident, or quasarscan.

Documentation is not quite ready yet, unfortunately. Stay tuned!

Installation
